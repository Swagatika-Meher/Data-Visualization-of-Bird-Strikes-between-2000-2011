# Data-Visualization-of-Bird-Strikes-between-2000-2011
Explore FAA's data on bird strikes (2000-2011) through compelling visualizations. Delve into the environmental and safety implications of bird strikes in transport, shedding light on crucial analytics for aviation and urban development.
## Problem Statement:
Transport and communication are in the crucial domain in the field of analytics. Environmental impacts and safety are, nowadays, two major concerns of the scientific community with respect to transport scenarios and to the ever-growing urban areas.
Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater numbers of birds in flight at lower levels. To have a closer look the following document visually depicts the data collected on Bird Strikes by FAA between 2000-2011.

* Yearly Cost Incurred due to Bird Strikes:
* When do most bird strikes occur?
* Altitude of airplanes at the time of strike
* Phase of flight at the time of the strike.
* Average Altitude of the airplanes in different phases at the time of strike
* Effect of Bird Strikes & Impact on Flight
* Effect of Strike at Different Altitude
* Were Pilots Informed? & Prior Warning and Effect of Strike Relation

## Approach
The main goal of the project is to find key metrics and factors and then show meaningful relationships between them based on different features available in the dataset.
```
Data Collection : Imported data from various datasets available in the project using Pandas library. 

Data Cleaning : Removed missing values and created new features as per insights. 

Data Preprocessing : Modified the structure of data in order to make it more understandable and suitable and convenient for statistical analysis. 

Data Analysis : I started analyzing dataset using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

Data Visualization : Plotted graphs to get insights about dependent and independent variables. Also used Tableau for data visualization.

We can see that 2010 has then highest number of bird strike incidents.
